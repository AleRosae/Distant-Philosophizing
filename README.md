# Distant-Philosophizing
This repository has been created to host the files related to the final project of the Digital Text in the Humanities held by Prof. Fabio Ciotti at the University of Bologna.
The goal of the project is to exploit computational tools and quantitative analysis to help scholar studies in the humanities. In particular, I selected a specifc issue in the historiography of western philosophy and tried to tackle it by analysing the textual features of a limited sample of philosophical essays ranging from ancient Greek to contemporary analytical philsophy. 
You can find detailed information about the project and the results in the .ppt file. If you want to check the Python code that was implemented, you can open the Colab notebook uploaded here or go to: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oiQi9ynxayiZiyvV9Mwjl2OzqgiC7F1e?usp=sharing
